// I. Variables & Data Types
// A. Q + A
/*How do we assign a value to a variable?
A: Using an assignment operator

How do we change the value of a variable?
A: first we have to assign the value to a variable using "var " or "let" keywords then we can change value of that variable just assigning the variable name to new value.
Example:
let a=10;
a=20;


How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
A: First we have to create a variable and assign to a value using var or let keywords then assign first variable to second using assignment operator.
 Example: let a=10;
    let b=a;


Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
A: Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable. 
Storing a value to a declared variable using assignment operator is called "assign".
Creating a name for block of code is called "define"

What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
A: Easy to understand text description that has only logic but not actual code written in any language.

What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?
A:  I would take 80% to think and 20% to type.

// B. Strings
Create a variable called firstVariable
Assign it the value of the string "Hello World"
Change the value of this variable to some number
Store the value of firstVariablein a new variable called secondVariable
Change the value of secondVariableto any string.
What is the value of firstVariable?
Create a variable called yourName and set it equal to your name as a string. Then, write an expression that takes the string "Hello, my name is " and the variable yourName so that it returns a new string with them concatenated.
ex: Hello, my name is Jean Valjean
A:
let firstVariable="Hello World";
firstVariable=100;
let secondVariable=firstVariable;
secondVariable="Welcome";
console.log(firstVariable);
let yourName="Shilpa";
let expression="Hello, my name is ";
console.log(expression+yourName);


// C. Booleans
  const a = 4;
  const b = 53;
  const c = 57;
  const d = 16;
  const e = 'Kevin';

  console.log(a < b);
  console.log(c > d);
  console.log('Name' === 'Name');
  // FOR THE NEXT TWO, USE ONLY && OR ||
  console.log(true || false);
  console.log(false || false || false || false || false || true);
  console.log(false && false && false && false && false || true);
  console.log(false == false)
  console.log(e === 'Kevin');
  console.log(a + b == c); // note: a < b < c is NOT CORRECT (and is not a valid JS expression, think about using other math operations)
  console.log(a * a == d); // note: the answer is a simple arithmetic equation, not something "weird"
  console.log(48 == '48');
 

// D. The Farm
Declare a variable animal. Set it to be either "cow" or something else
Write code that will print out "mooooo" if the it is equal to cow
Change your code so that if the variable animal is anything other than a cow, it will print "Hey! You're not a cow."
Commit
let animal="cat";
if(animal==="cow"){
console.log("moooo");
}else{
    console.log("Hey! You're not a cow.");
}



// E. Driver's Ed
//Make a variable that holds a person's age; be semantic
Write code that will print out "Here are the keys!", if the age is 16 years or older, or, if the age is younger than 16, a message should print "Sorry, you're too young."
