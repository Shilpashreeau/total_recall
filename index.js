// I. Variables & Data Types
// A. Q + A
/*How do we assign a value to a variable?
A: Using an assignment operator

How do we change the value of a variable?
A: first we have to assign the value to a variable using "var " or "let" keywords then we can change value of that variable just assigning the variable name to new value.
Example:
let a=10;
a=20;


How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
A: First we have to create a variable and assign to a value using var or let keywords then assign first variable to second using assignment operator.
 Example: let a=10;
    let b=a;


Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
A: Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable. 
Storing a value to a declared variable using assignment operator is called "assign".
Creating a name for block of code is called "define"

What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
A: Easy to understand text description that has only logic but not actual code written in any language.

What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?
A:  I would take 80% to think and 20% to type.

// B. Strings
Create a variable called firstVariable
Assign it the value of the string "Hello World"
Change the value of this variable to some number
Store the value of firstVariablein a new variable called secondVariable
Change the value of secondVariableto any string.
What is the value of firstVariable?
Create a variable called yourName and set it equal to your name as a string. Then, write an expression that takes the string "Hello, my name is " and the variable yourName so that it returns a new string with them concatenated.
ex: Hello, my name is Jean Valjean
A:
let firstVariable="Hello World";
firstVariable=100;
let secondVariable=firstVariable;
secondVariable="Welcome";
console.log(firstVariable);
let yourName="Shilpa";
let expression="Hello, my name is ";
console.log(expression+yourName);


// C. Booleans
  const a = 4;
  const b = 53;
  const c = 57;
  const d = 16;
  const e = 'Kevin';

  console.log(a < b);
  console.log(c > d);
  console.log('Name' === 'Name');
  // FOR THE NEXT TWO, USE ONLY && OR ||
  console.log(true || false);
  console.log(false || false || false || false || false || true);
  console.log(false && false && false && false && false || true);
  console.log(false == false)
  console.log(e === 'Kevin');
  console.log(a + b == c); // note: a < b < c is NOT CORRECT (and is not a valid JS expression, think about using other math operations)
  console.log(a * a == d); // note: the answer is a simple arithmetic equation, not something "weird"
  console.log(48 == '48');
 

// D. The Farm
Declare a variable animal. Set it to be either "cow" or something else
Write code that will print out "mooooo" if the it is equal to cow
Change your code so that if the variable animal is anything other than a cow, it will print "Hey! You're not a cow."
Commit
let animal="cat";
if(animal==="cow"){
console.log("moooo");
}else{
    console.log("Hey! You're not a cow.");
}



// E. Driver's Ed
//Make a variable that holds a person's age; be semantic
Write code that will print out "Here are the keys!", if the age is 16 years or older, or, if the age is younger than 16, a message should print "Sorry, you're too young."


let age=20;
if(age>=16){
console.log("Here are the keys!");
}else {
    console.log("Sorry, you're too young.")
}


//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// II. Loops
// A. The Basics
/*Write a loop that will print out all the numbers from 0 to 10, inclusive
for(let i=0;i<=10;i++){
    console.log(i);
}

Write a loop that will print out all the numbers from 10 up to and including 400
for(let i=10;i<=400;i++){
    console.log(i);
}
//Write a loop that will print out every third number starting with 12 and going no higher than 4000
for(let i=12;i<4000;i+=3){
    console.log(i);
}
// B. Get even
//Print out the numbers that are within the range of 1 - 100
for(let i=2;i<=100;i+=2){
console.log(i);
}
//Adjust your code to add a message next to even numbers only that says: "<-- is an even number"
for(let i=2;i<=100;i+=2){
    console.log(`${i} is an even number`);
    }*/
// C. Give me Five
//For the numbers 0 - 100, print out "I found a number. High five!" if the number is a multiple of five
// for(let i=0;i<=100;i++){
//     if(i===0){
//     continue;
//     }
// if(i%5==0){
// console.log(`I found a ${i}. High five!`);
// }

// }
/*Add to the code from above to print out "I found a number. Three is a crowd" if the number is a multiple of three


    for (let i = 0; i <= 100; i++){
        if (i % 5 === 0 && i % 3 === 0) {
         console.log(`I found a ${i}. High Five! Three is a crowd`)
        } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
         console.log(`I found a ${i}. Three is a crowd`)
        } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
         console.log(`I found a ${i}. High Five!`)
        }
       }
    
*/

// D. Savings account
/*Write code that will save the sum of all the numbers between 1 - 10 to a variable called bank_account.
Check your work! Your bank_account should have $55 in it.
let bank_account=0;
for(i=1;i<=10;i++){
    bank_account+=i;

}
console.log(bank_account);*/


/*You got a bonus! Your pay is now doubled each week. Write code that will save the sum of all the numbers between 1 - 100 multiplied by 2.
Check your work! Your bank_account should have $10,100 in it.

let bank_account=0;
for(i=1;i<=100;i++){
    bank_account+=i;

}
console.log(bank_account*2);*/

// III. Arrays & Control Flow
// A. Talk about it:
/*What are the things in an array called?
Answer:Array elements

Do Arrays guarantee those things will be in order?
Answer: Yes elements in arrays are ordered can be referred by their indexes.

What real-life thing could you model with an array?
Answer:Shopping cart*/

// B. Easy Does It
//Create an array that contains three quotes and store it in a variable called quotes
//let quotes=["Live","Love","Care"];

// C. Accessing elements
const randomThings = [1, 10, "Hello", true]
//How do you access the 1st element in the array?
randomThings[0];
//Change the value of "Hello"to "World"
randomThings[2]="World";
//Check the value of the array to make sure it updated the array. How? Why, yes! console.log();
console.log(randomThings);

// D. Change values
const ourClass = ["Salty", "Zoom", "Sardine", "Slack", "Github"];
//What would you write to access the 3rd element of the array?
ourClass[2];
//Change the value of "Github" to "Octocat"
ourClass[4]="Octocat";
//Add a new element, "Cloud City" to the array

ourClass.push("Cloud City");
console.log(ourClass);
// E. Mix It Up
const myArray = [5, 10, 500, 20];
//Add the string "Aegon"to the end of the array. Add another string of your choice to the end of the array.
myArray.push('Aegon');
myArray.push("Lotus");
console.log(myArray);

//Remove the 5from the beginning of the array.
myArray.shift()
console.log(myArray);

//Add the string "Bob Marley"to the beginning of the array.
myArray.unshift("Bob Marley");
console.log(myArray);

//Remove the string of your choice from the end of the array.
myArray.pop();
console.log(myArray);
//Reverse this array using Array.prototype.reverse(). Did you mutate the array? What does mutate mean? Did the .reverse()method return anything?
myArray.reverse();
console.log(myArray);
// Answer: changing the order in an array is mutate . reverse() method returned opposite direction of original array

// F. Biggie Smalls
let a=prompt("Please enter the number");

//console.log()s "little number" if the number is entered is less than 100
if(Number(a)){
if(a<100){
console.log("little number");
}
//console.log()s big number if the number is greater than or equal to 100.

else{
    console.log("big number");
}
}else{
console.log("Please enter number");
}

// G. Monkey in the Middle
//console.log()little number if the number entered is less than 5.
//If the number entered is more than 10, log big number.
//Otherwise, log "monkey".
let b=prompt("Please enter the number");

if(Number(b)){
    if(b<5){
    console.log("little number");
    }
    else if(b>10){
        console.log("big number");
    }
    else{
        console.log("monkey");
    }
}else{
    console.log("Please enter number");
}
